# DAMAT: Data-driven Mutation Analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems

This project provides DAMAT (DAta-driven Mutation Analysis with Tables), a data-driven mutation analysis tool. DAMAT is described in our paper Data-driven Mutation Analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems, Enrico Vigan√≤, Oscar Cornejo, Fabrizio Pastore, Lionel Briand. The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10160. The development of DAMAT is supported by the ESA projects  FAQAS and FAQAS2 (see http://faqas.uni.lu).

A tutorial for DAMAT is avalable at https://github.com/SNTSVV/DAMAT_Tutorial.

In /mutator you will find the source code for the DAMAT mutation API generator and its unit test suite.
In /damat-pipeline you will find the DAMAT mutation analysis pipeline (i.e., what to use to perform mutation analysis).
Please refer to the README inside those folders for more detailed information.
