# FAQAS_DataDrivenMutator

This project describes the FAQAS DataDrivenMutator to execute data-driven mutaton of systems that work with buffers.

DAMAT is described in our paper Data-driven Mutation Analysis for Cyber-Physical Systems, Enrico Vigan√≤, Oscar Cornejo, Fabrizio Pastore, Lionel Briand. The paper is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10160. 

A tutorial for DAMAT is avalable at https://github.com/SNTSVV/DAMAT_Tutorial.

In /mutator you will find the source code for the DAMAt mutation API generator and the unit test suite.
In /damat-pipeline you will find the DAMAt pipeline.

Please refer to the README inside those folders for more detailed information.
